# werewolf-survivors
Werewolf Survivors is a simple game running on a modularized engine I built in Java. The game was for my AI in Games course at Athabasca University.


**INSTALLATION GUIDE**

Inside the source code folder is a folder titled WerewolfSurvivors. Open this folder as a project within IntelliJ or any other IDE. From here, you should simply have to compile the code and it will run though you may need to target the assets folder as the resources folder depending on your environment. For further guidance, check the PDF in the documentation folder.
